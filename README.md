# QiskitNotebooks

Repository containing notebooks on quantum algorithms. These notebooks are for educational purposes only. The "qiskit" library in python provides a platform to build quantum circuits and a quantum simulator on which one can simulate an experiment and check the expected outcome. Performing experiments on a real quantum device never really given a 100% correct answer due to noise.
